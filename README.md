### Welcome to the Workshop
Are you ready to build a chat bot? In this workshop, we'll learn a few of the basics in conversation design. Together with Google Engineers, you'll customize a simple project and learn to use DialogFlow.  To get the most out of this experience, we ask that you read through this Guide and setup your Perfect Pizza Project in advance. This guide will help you get setup in just a few easy steps.

### Step 1: Download the files
You can download the Perfect Pizza files from this GitHub repository. Select the **green Code button** and then select **Download ZIP** to save to your computer. **Pro Tip: save the files to your desktop** so they are within easy reach.

### Step 2: Log in to DialogFlow
Go to the <a href = "http://dialogflow.cloud.google.com">dialogflow console</a> and sign in with your gmail account. (Note: If you don’t have gmail, you can create a new account at gmail.com.  Here’s how: <a href="https://youtu.be/kw2eFtZXDho" target="_blank">3 minute tutorial</a>.)

### Step 3: Create New Agent
In the upper left corder of the DialogFlow Window, directly under the logo - there is little dropdown arrow. Click the arrow to open the menu and then select **Create New Agent**. **Give your agent a name** such as test_agent or almost_perfect_pizza.

### Step 4: Import Files
In the upper left corner of the DialogFlow window, and just to the right of your agent’s name, you should see the gear icon. **Click on the gear icon and select Export and Import** from the menu. Then select **RESTORE FROM ZIP** and **locate** the **perfect_pizza_START.zip** file. Selecting this file automatically imports the contents. In this way, we are all working on the same starter conversation together. You can customize and turn this almost-perfect-pizza into your perfect pie.

### Step 5: Test Your Setup
As you may have noticed,  right hand column of the DialogFlow interface  is for testing. At the top, there’s a grey box that says “ Try it now”. **Greet your new agent by typing “Hi” or “hello” in the box and hit enter**. This is how you can chat with your new bot.


### Step 6: Make Your Pizza Perfect
Congratulations! You’ve created your first agent. We’re excited to join you in the workshop and to help customize your Perfect Pizza. In the meantime, to learn more, check out a few handy resources below.
