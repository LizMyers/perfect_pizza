### Welcome to the Workshop
Are you ready to build a chat bot? In this workshop, we'll learn a few of the basics in conversation design. Together with Google Engineers, you'll customize a simple project and learn to use DialogFlow.  To get the most out of this experience, we ask that you read through this Guide and **setup your Perfect Pizza Project in advance**. That way we can maximize our time together.

### Step 1: Download the files
You can download the Perfect Pizza files from this GitHub repository. Select the **green Code button** and then select **Download ZIP** to save to your computer. **Pro Tip: unzip the MASTER** so that you can see these two separate files: **perfect_pizza_START.zip** and **perfect_pizza_finish.zip**.

### Step 2: Log in to DialogFlow
Go to the <a href = "http://dialogflow.cloud.google.com">dialogflow console</a> and sign in with your gmail account. (Note: If you don’t have gmail, you can create a new account at gmail.com.  Here’s how: <a href="https://youtu.be/kw2eFtZXDho" target="_blank">3 minute tutorial</a>.)

### Step 3: Create New Agent
Next we need to **Create a New Agent**. If you're new to DialogFlow, you should see this button in the upper left corner. If you don't see<br /> the "+ Create Agent" button, click the drown-down arrow and select **Create New Agent** from the menu. **Give your agent a name** such as test_agent or my_pizza. Agent names can not be changed later - so create a simple name, using words commonly found in the English dictionary.

### Step 4: Import Files
In the upper left corner of the DialogFlow window, and just to the right of your agent’s name, you should see the gear icon. **Click on the gear icon and select Export and Import** from the menu. Then select **RESTORE FROM ZIP** and **locate** the **perfect_pizza_START.zip** file. Be sure and type RESTORE (all caps) in the grey box. Then the **CREATE button** becomes available and you can click it. Now you're ready to turn this almost-perfect-pizza into *your perfect pie*.

### Step 5: Test Your Setup
As you may have noticed, the right hand column of the DialogFlow interface  is for testing. At the top, there’s a grey box that says “ Try it now”. **Greet your new agent by typing “Hi” or “hello” in the box and hit enter**. This is how you can chat with your new bot.


### Step 6: Make It *Yours*
Congratulations! You’ve created your first chat bot. We’re excited to join you in the workshop and to help customize your Perfect Pizza. In the meantime, you can learn more about conversation design by checking the resources below.
